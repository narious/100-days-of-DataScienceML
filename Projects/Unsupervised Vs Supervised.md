##Supervised Learning
1. Initial data contains data points with the "real" predicted value
2. Examples
	1. Predicting house prices depending on size. (regression problem)
	2. Predicted whether a breast cancer will be malignant depending on size, age, etc. (classification problem)


##Unsupervised Learning
1. Contains the data points without "real" predicted value (no labels). The learning algorithm must find a pattern in the data
2. Examples
	1. Google news
	2. Grouping customer data
