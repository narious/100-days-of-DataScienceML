##Supervised Learning
1. Initial data contains data points with the "real" predicted value
2. Examples
	1. Predicting house prices depending on size. (regression problem)
	2. Predicted whether a breast cancer will be malignant depending on size, age, etc. (classification problem)


##Unsupervised Learning
1. Contains the data points without "real" predicted value (no labels). The learning algorithm must find a pattern in the data
2. Derive structure from where there is non. No feedback based on prediction results
3. Examples
	1. Google news (clustering)
	2. Grouping customer data (clustering)
	3. Cocktail party algorithm: Find structure in chaotic environment (non-clustering)
